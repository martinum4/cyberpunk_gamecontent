# Cyberpunk 2077 File Contents

Filelists and descriptions, hopefully this will be helpful for modders and people generally interested in the game.

If it isn't obvious: Due to copyright-restrictions i can't upload the files themself, you have to extract and convert them yourself.


Helpful links (no warranty/liability):

https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/chnea2/how_to_convert_wem_files_to_ogg/ <- The audio quality archived by this tool doesn't seem as good as it could be, other links are appreciated.


So far this repository contains information about the music and soundbank folder, i will add informations about the quest when i find them.

All help, let it be comments, issues or pull requests are appreciated.

Kind Regards

Martin
